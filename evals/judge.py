MATCH_PROMPT = """\
You are evaluating a tool that finds implicit design decisions in code.
Match each PREDICTED decision to at most one LABELLED decision (the ground
truth). A match means they are about the same underlying decision and
consequence, even if worded differently or cited at slightly different
lines. A prediction that only touches the same code but is about a
different consequence is NOT a match.

For predictions with no match, judge whether it is still a real,
consequential design decision supported by the code (not style, not
trivia, not hallucinated).

Return exactly one entry per predicted decision.

LABELLED decisions:
{labels}

PREDICTED decisions:
{predicted}

Code the tool was shown:

QUALITY_PROMPT = """\
You are evaluating Socratic questions a tool asks a developer about design
decisions in their own (possibly AI-written) code. The goal of each
question is to make the developer derive the consequence themselves.

Score each question 1-5 on each criterion (5 = excellent):
- grounded: the setup/question's claims follow from the code shown
- important: understanding this matters in code review, incidents, handoffs
- non_leaking: neither the setup nor the question gives away the consequence
  or the fix (a question that says "given the race condition..." leaks)
- specific: a concrete scenario tied to this code, not generic advice
- answerable: a developer could answer in a few sentences by reading the code

Be strict: 3 is acceptable, 5 is rare.
